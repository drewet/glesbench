Here you can find latest versions of two OpenGL apps:

1) Bunny (little benchmark itself);
2) Clear (simple app that do nothing but clears framebuffer and shows FPS);

The purpose of Bunny demo is to test workload of fragment shader: 
5 point lights with phong shading applied to hi-poly model.
I planned to use 8 point lights for pretty high workload, but seems that there is 
limitation in mobile GPUs for this, so I limited shader to use 5 point lights.

You can build the samples using make:

make -f x11 - for desktop build
make -f sdl-arm - for HP Touchpad
make -f egl-arm - for LG TV

For touchpad build PalmPDK should be installed.
For TV you should correct paths in "egl-arm" makefile to goldinger usr directory and ARM compiler (I harcoded them for now).
When building for multiple targets, do not forget to exec make -f <target> clean.

Or you can use binaries from repo:

bunny (x86)
bunny-sdl (HPT)
bunny-egl (TV)

clear (x86)
clear-sdl (HPT)
clear-egl (TV)

When run on TV, be sure that Starfish image has at least libGLESv2.so, libEGL.so and libIMGegl.so.
Also make sure that file "phong.psh" is exists alongside with binary file.

EGL version supports multisampling option (antialiazing).
To enable it, run program with parameter -m <N>, where N is number of samples per pixel, e.g.:

./bunny -m 4

Seems that TV supports 2, 4 and 8 MSAA modes.
